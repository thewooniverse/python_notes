    USAGE:
    ______
    password_keeper.py [get] [keyword] - get the saved password from db, decrypt with a PIN which is inputted
    password_keeper.py [save] [keyword] - save a new password from clipboard, encrypt with PIN and save to db[keyword]
    password_keeper.py [list] - lists all for saved passwords keywords
    password_keeper.py [help] - prints the USAGE string to terminal

    it is recommended that a strong, master password is used to maintain the password db (encrypt and decrypt)
    it may also be common practice that the keyword is a username
    please be sure to have the password copied onto the clipboard if you are running the save command
    any existing clipboard items will be overwritten if the list or get commands are used.
