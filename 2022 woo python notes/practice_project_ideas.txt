0. password keeper / protector

1. markdown email template generator for CS tickets
- takes clipboarded username, and fills in everything for the given support ticket type

2. Regex Search files (both .txt, .md etc... to scrape for stuff)


3. Cards against humanity with Regex and files

4. strong password detector
