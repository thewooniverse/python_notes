Journal;

It's actually pretty fun and exciting, building things;
Defining out different parts of how things will work, and building it out.
Really it was sticking with the learning curve, it sucks at times.
And I almost gave up;
But treating it as my duty, and really sticking to it allowed me to come out on the other side;
Now I quite enjoy programming.

Just the whole process of thinking;

Okay, here is what I need to build.
Here is what it's going to look like, here are the functionalities of all of that.
Here are how different scripts and docs will interact with each other.
Here is the database;
Here is how the user will interact with the system.
Here is the classes needed to implement this, that;
Here are the wrapper scripts.
